Abstract
High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA marker gene is the current benchmark in the characterization of bacterial microbial communities
from virtually all environments.
LotuS, IMNGS, MetaAmp, QIIME 1, sl10 (Whelan and Surette, 2017) apply among others make use of UPARSE or UCLUST as sole, amptK default
or optional parameters in their workflow. 
These pipelines claim that their usage addresses the need to be easy-to-use through the application of default or streamlined parameters.
